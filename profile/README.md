IoT Device Management Platform: Overview


Description: Create a platform to manage IoT devices, monitor their statuses, and control them remotely.

Device Service: Manages registration and communication with IoT devices.
Monitoring Service: Collects and stores telemetry data from devices.
Control Service: Sends commands to IoT devices for remote control.
User Service: Manages user accounts and authentication.
Alert Service: Generates alerts based on predefined conditions (e.g., device failure).
Tech Stack:

Backend: .NET Core microservices for each service
API Gateway: .NET Core for handling API requests
Message Broker: RabbitMQ for handling telemetry data and commands
Service Invocation & State Management: Dapr
Containerization: Docker for each microservice
Frontend: Angular for user interface
Database: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB for time-series data storage


How It Works
Device Registration and Communication:

IoT devices register with the Device Service.
The service maintains a list of all devices, their statuses, and communication details.
Devices periodically send telemetry data and status updates to the platform.
Telemetry Data Collection and Storage:

The Monitoring Service collects telemetry data from registered devices.
This data is stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB) for efficient querying and analysis.
The service processes incoming data to update device statuses and generate insights.
Remote Control of Devices:

The Control Service sends commands to IoT devices for remote operations (e.g., reboot, configuration changes).
Commands are queued and processed, ensuring reliable delivery even under high load.
User Management and Authentication:

The User Service handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
Users can log in to the platform to view device statuses, telemetry data, and send control commands.
User roles and permissions are managed to ensure secure access to sensitive operations.
Alert Generation:

The Alert Service monitors telemetry data and device statuses to detect predefined conditions (e.g., device failure, abnormal readings).
Alerts are generated and sent to users via email, SMS, or push notifications.
Frontend Interface:

An Angular-based frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing devices, viewing telemetry data, sending commands, and receiving alerts.
The frontend communicates with the backend services through the API Gateway.
API Gateway:

The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate backend services, providing a unified entry point for the frontend and external clients.
It handles authentication, rate limiting, and request aggregation.
Service Invocation and State Management:

Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is used for service invocation and state management, ensuring reliable and scalable inter-service communication.
Dapr provides abstractions for pub/sub messaging, state stores, and observability.
